This project focuses on developing a predictive system for smoke detection in industrial installations using sensor data. The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately identify the presence of smoke, enabling early warnings and preventing potential hazards.

Technologies Used

Python: For data preprocessing, model implementation, and visualization.

SQL (Teradata): For data extraction and management.

Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, LightGBM, and others for implementing predictive models.

IoT Sensors: Data sourced from various sensors monitoring environmental conditions.

Use Case

This smoke detection system is particularly valuable in industrial settings where early detection of smoke can prevent large-scale disasters. By automating the detection process and integrating with existing monitoring systems, the project enhances safety protocols and reduces the risk of fire-related incidents.
This project demonstrates the power of combining IoT sensor data with advanced machine learning techniques to create a robust smoke detection system. It highlights the practical application of data science in enhancing industrial safety and provides a solid foundation for further development and integration into larger safety systems.
